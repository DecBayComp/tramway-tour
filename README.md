# Notebook-based documentation for TRamWAy

Website: [tramway-tour.readthedocs.io](https://tramway-tour.readthedocs.io)

This project is a rework of **TRamWAy** documentation in the shape of IPython notebooks.
The content of this new [documentation website](https://tramway-tour.readthedocs.io) and that of the original [documentation](https://tramway.readthedocs.io) are more complimentary than redundant.

The TRamWAy library is available [elsewhere](https://github.com/DecBayComp/TRamWAy).

The material and especially the code examples in this repository are distributed under the terms of the [Zero-Clause BSD license](LICENSE), which grants more freedom than the CECILL-2.1 license used for the [TRamWAy library](https://github.com/DecBayComp/TRamWAy).
