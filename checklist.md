The release procedure is not fully automated yet and involves a lot of manual interventions and checks.

# Hyperlinks

* in *inference.ipynb*

  * the *preset analyzer source* hyperlink should point to the function definition in the target file
    and preferably for an explicitly defined release of the documentation project;
    this should be checked before running `make pages`

# Building

The main building step is performed calling `make pages`.
Ensure the notebooks are saved beforehands, preferably closed.

# Highlights

This does not apply to current version *0.2*.

* for *inference.ipynb*, the *docs/inference.md.patch* patch should be updated if necessary and applied after `make pages` updates *docs/inference.md*

# Package data

Static images generated by `make pages` should be included in the *package_data.tar.bz2* file:

* delete the existing *docs/&ast;_files* with `make clean`
* build with `make pages`
* regenerate the *package_data.tar.bz2* file with `make data`
* on *dl.pasteur.fr* (maintainer only), delete the existing *package_data.tar.bz2* file
  and upload the new file
* compute the checksum of the new file, *e.g.* in IPython:

    import hashlib
    with open('package_data.tar.bz2', 'rb') as f:
        print(hashlib.md5(f.read()).hexdigest())

* update the checksum in the *Makefile* file

The *data/Image_8bit.tif* file is shipped separately; check for its availability on *dl.pasteur.fr*
