    "\n",
    "Once the localized or tracked data are loaded as a dataframe, regions of interest can be selected at particle density peaks, for example as square areas centered at these peak locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tramway.analyzer.roi.utils` module exports a simple `density_based_roi` function to do so, as an example. Its usage is better illustrated in [another notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DecBayComp/TRamWAy/HEAD?filepath=notebooks%2FRWAnalyzer%20tour.ipynb#ROI-definition) (section *ROI definition*), part of the TRamWAy project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time support for each space ROI can also be restricted to a time segment with relatively sustained density.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRamWAy does not encourage a specific approach, but the general rule is to select regions that contain enough data for the estimation techniques involved at the inference stage to work properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering coordinates named `'x'`, `'y'` (space), `'t'` (time), regions of interest can be defined as bounding boxes, in a dataframe with one row per ROI, and columns `'x min'`, `'x max'`, `'y min'`, `'y max'`, `'t min'`, `'t max'`, etc."
